# Deep-Learning
The revised codes(by me) about some basic but important Deep Learning Projects<br>
I revised the codes here, it guarantees that I obey the honor code in Coursera. 
###### I know that sklearn package has a lot of funtions which are much better than mine, but it is a good way to solid my knowledge in DL.
##### LR with NN structure to recongize a cat and L_layers neural network without regularization



#### L_layers neural network
Compared with the code in Coursera.
I update the sigmoid_backward and relu_backward function and do some revises about the original funtions

Firstly,DNN is written well by those experts in sklearn.<br>
But if u dont wanna read the complex codes in sklearn and are lazy to build an NN by yourself, u can consider my structure about DNN ,again, without regularization (I will write it in short future). <br> 

Then,My acc is 96.6% which is not as high as the best result(99%).<br>

My code will compute infinite(Nan Inf) if the parameters and the learning rate are not good. I guess is because of the convex property about the cost function, but I am not sure.<br>

Anyway,It my first Deep_Learning(L-layers) program(Like a library). If u find any mistakes, please connect me by e-mail without hesitination,【jiangsy@snnu.edu.cn】I am super willing to learn DL together with u.
